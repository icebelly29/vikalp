            <h2><a href=""> 2. Schools</a></h2>
            <p> he first problem is the school itself. Many of these schools are structured makeshift huts, with no proper doors, windows, or walls. With simple infrastructure, the schools in these rural areas are extremely prone to the natural elements like rain water leaking through roofs, mould developing on the walls and termites. There is also insufficient furniture, chairs and desks to cater to each child. Building furnitureand decent infrastructure for these kids is something we at Vikalp can take care of.</p>

            <h2><a href=""> Teachers </a></h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, most rural teachers are not academically trained. 
                Additionally, most students are all placed in one single class, regardless of age. This results in overcrowded classrooms. As a result, the teachers also face difficulty in giving enough attention to each student.
                We're determined to ask the government for help on this one. Bringing in new teachers, who are well qualified enough to raise the young generation is something we're aimming to achieve. Put a number or something here from where to get teachers.

            <h2><a href=""> 4. Taking help from The Patatas</a></h2>
            <p>To solve the obvious issue of lack of technology in rural areas for education, we plan on taking inspiration and contacting Digi-Eskwela Project E-learning Tablets. 
                The Patatas is a group of social innovators who actively look for ways to ease problems faced by these rural and underprivileged communities. The Digi-Eskwela project introduces e-learning via tablets to children in the rural areas of Asia. The project focuses on gamification and mobile technology to supplement traditional classroom learning. By introducing tablets and weaving educational content into games, the children will be more engaged and eager to learn. The tablet acts as a platform for educational materials instead of physical textbooks and subjects or modules are preloaded according to the curriculum. Therefore, schools and students would not need to spend extra money on purchasing textbooks when the information is available on a compact tablet. Teachers also undergo training to ensure they are well prepared to conduct lessons with the tablet.
